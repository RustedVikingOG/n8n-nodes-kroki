# COLLABORATION GUIDE: n8n-nodes-kroki Project

## Overview

This project is a custom n8n community node package that provides diagram conversion capabilities using the Kroki service. It enables n8n workflows to convert text-based diagrams (like Mermaid, PlantUML, GraphViz, and many others) into image formats (PNG, SVG, PDF). The main use cases include automated diagram generation in documentation pipelines, dynamic visualization creation from data, integrating diagram creation into workflow automation, and converting multiple diagram formats as part of content processing workflows.

---

## Project Structure & Responsibilities

The project follows the standard n8n community node package structure with TypeScript development and build processes, specifically tailored for Kroki diagram conversion.

## Debugging

Provides a set of strategies for debugging projects in this codebase.

**Debugging Strategy: Docker Testing Environment**

```sh
# Start the testing environment
cd n8n_test_env
docker-compose -f compose.n8n-service.yaml up -d

# Check service status
docker-compose -f compose.n8n-service.yaml ps

# View n8n logs
docker-compose -f compose.n8n-service.yaml logs n8n

# Access n8n web interface
open http://localhost:5678

# Stop the testing environment
docker-compose -f compose.n8n-service.yaml down
```

**Debugging Strategy: Kroki Integration Testing**

```sh
# Test Kroki service connectivity
curl -X POST "https://kroki.io/mermaid/svg" \
  -H "Content-Type: text/plain" \
  -d "graph TD; A-->B;"

# Test with different diagram types and formats
# PNG: https://kroki.io/{diagram-type}/png
# SVG: https://kroki.io/{diagram-type}/svg  
# PDF: https://kroki.io/{diagram-type}/pdf
```

**Debugging Strategy: Build error recovery**

```sh
# Clean build artifacts
npx rimraf dist

# Rebuild from scratch
npm run build

# Check TypeScript compilation
npx tsc --noEmit

# Verify package structure
npm pack --dry-run
```

**DEBUGGING: GOTCHAs AND RECOVERY**

A list of tips and tricks for dealing with debugging gotchas.
NOTE: !! do not change this.

- The ERROR: "Unexpected eof" (end of file) | Can typically mean there is a missing or extra bracket/parenthesis. However, can be sometimes caused by mis-aligned quote types (i.e. opening quote: \' while closing quote '") or additionally by missing tags. Please rewrite the given file to fix the error even if it looks correct. Mistakes happen.
- Node registration errors: Ensure the `package.json` n8n configuration points to `dist/nodes/Kroki/Kroki.node.js`
- TypeScript compilation issues: Check `tsconfig.json` configuration and ensure all imports are properly typed
- Icon loading problems: Verify that `kroki.svg` file is being copied to `dist/nodes/Kroki/` directory by the gulp build process
- n8n integration issues: Use the Docker testing environment to validate node behavior in a real n8n instance
- Kroki API connectivity: Test diagram conversion endpoints directly using curl or browser to verify service availability
- Docker environment issues: Check logs with `docker-compose logs` and ensure ports 5432 and 5678 are available

## Git Commit Best Practices

The required git commit policies to follow.
NOTE: !! do not change this.

**Git Commands**

- Use the `git status` command to get a clear view of what you are updating.
- Add and commit your changes with a helpful message using `git add -A && git commit -m '[HELPFUL COMMIT MESSAGE HERE]'`

**Basic Rules**
- Git commits should be a wrapper for related changes. For example, fixing two different bugs should produce two separate commits. 
- Commit Often to keep your commits small to enable better reporting on changes and git history management.
- Don't Commit Half-Done Work, only commit code when a logical component is completed. Split a feature's implementation into logical chunks that can be completed quickly so that you can commit often.
- Test Your Code Before You Commit. Follow the Debugging Strategies.
Resist the temptation to commit something that you «think» is completed. Test it thoroughly by making sure the code builds.
- Write clear and Good Commit Messages and keep [.docs/CHANGELOG.md] is up to date. Begin your message with a short summary of your changes (up to 50 characters as a guideline). Separate it from the following body by including a blank line. The body of your message should provide detailed answers to the following questions: – What was the motivation for the change? – How does it differ from the previous implementation? Use the imperative, present tense («change», not «changed» or «changes») to be consistent with generated messages from commands like git merge.

## Collaboration Tips

A summarization of the Collaboration tips and tricks.
NOTE: !! do not change this.

- Keep diagram conversion logic separated and well-documented for maintainability
- Test with multiple diagram types and formats to ensure broad compatibility
- Use the Docker testing environment for comprehensive integration testing
- Use clear commit messages and PR descriptions with example diagrams when relevant
- Document new diagram types, output formats, and configuration options in the `.docs/` folder
- Update this guide as the project evolves and new Kroki features are integrated
